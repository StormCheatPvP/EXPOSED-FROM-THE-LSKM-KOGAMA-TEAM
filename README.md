 IN THIS FILE I WILL LEAK SOME GUYS WHO WORK WITH ME ON A CHEAT


Well, it all started yesterday, when I was on a call with my work colleagues on the new kogama cheat
Until I pretended that my audio changed due to a discord update bug
And my friend (Afonso) said the following: Taking advantage of the fact that Storm is mutated, I'm going to leak his IP to you.

And my friend ( Talita ), decided to look for information about me, TO PUT IT IN THE CHEAT CREDITS

That's it for now, when I have a call with them again, I'll leak more things
